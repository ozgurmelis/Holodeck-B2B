Holodeck B2B
============

Holodeck B2B is a standalone B2B messaging solution that implements the OASIS specifications for ebMS3 and the AS4 profile. As it is Java based it will run on most platforms. Java 7 is required to run Holodeck B2B itself (as provided in this projects). Extensions however may need Java 8. It is designed with extensibility in mind providing an interface layer, which you can find in the interface module, and lots of documentation inside the code.
